# 18-10-onwards-Dsa

The codes would be in curated way in github , either imported from leetcode , vs-code or any other editor.
The name would be specified of each question and will be placed in that particular topic folder.

However if you don't find it in github check your written dsa notes once

If in notes the questions aren't clear , you may also visit ' Take you forward website' and go to Striver's A-Z DSA sheet and check the solutions there.  

Open Striver A-Z dsa sheet and go to some question explanation. If not written in notes than either in code or refer 'Take you forward'.
